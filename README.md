# Jili Random Game Picker

This is a simple web page that picks a random Jili game.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main page.
- `style.css`: Styling (Neon/Dark theme).
- `script.js`: Logic for random picker and animation.
- `data.js`: List of games. **Edit this file to add more games or update images.**
- `assets/`: Folder containing images.

## Customizing Images
I have included 3 high-quality placeholder images for the demo. 
To add real game images:
1.  Download the game images you want.
2.  Save them in the `assets/` folder.
3.  Update `data.js` to point to the correct filenames.

Example in `data.js`:
```javascript
{ name: "New Game", image: "assets/new_game_image.png" },
```

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in your browser.
